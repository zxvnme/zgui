Simple, two file immediate mode gui framework written in **C++17**, mainly aimed for people beginning their journey with game hacking (but not limited to).
Its main goals are to be **universal** (it works on all graphics APIs; DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan etc.) and **dependency free**. Therefore zgui is really **easy to use** and it has simple but aesthetic UI that can be extended or modified easily too.

All functions of framework are described in [header file](zgui.hh).  
Dont forget to check out [official zgui wiki](https://github.com/zxvnme/zgui/wiki), you will find there documentation of zgui and guide how to use zgui.  

Also shoutout to [alphauc](https://github.com/alphauc) for example zgui implementation in his [SDK](https://github.com/alphauc/sdk)

See gif for preview.
